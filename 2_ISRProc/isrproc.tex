%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Intro %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This chapter will give the background on the signal model and processing aspects of ISR. The first section will explore the physical  underpinning of the incoherent scatter signal from the ionosphere. The next section will detail the basics of radar processing and how the different types of measurements are made. Lastly, the specific processing that takes place in an ISR will be detailed.

\section{Incoherent Scatter}

When electrons are freed from their bonds as in a plasma they can oscillate and act as a dipole. If an electromagnetic wave, such as one from a radar pulse, impinges on these electrons they will accelerate and re-radiate a wave, this is known as Thomson scatter \cite{Hutchinson_2002}. This radiation, when taken as a collection of scatters from a large set of electrons, varies in time, $t$, with the fluctuations in electron density $n_e(\mathbf{k},t)$, where $\mathbf{k}$ is the Bragg vector \cite{kudeki:milla:1}. In the far-field condition the Bragg vector is defined as the following,

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:bragg}
\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{k}_s-\mathbf{k}_i,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathbf{k}_s$ and $\mathbf{k}_i$ are the wavenumbers for scattered and incident waves respectively \cite{sheffield2010}. The Bragg vector is the frequency parameter in $n_e(\mathbf{k},t)$, where is the spatial Fourier transform of $n_e(\mathbf{r},t)$ where $\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector. As these charges move the scattered wave are given a Doppler shift based off of their velocity, $\mathbf{v}$ along the Bragg vector. This Doppler shift in frequency can be represented as the following 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:dop1}
\omega=\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{v},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\omega$ is the frequency shift from the velocity along the Bragg vector \cite{sheffield2010}. In the end $n_e(\mathbf{k}, \omega)$ can be thought of as both the Fourier Transform along time of $n_e(\mathbf{k},t)$ and the collective Doppler spectrum from the density at a specific Bragg vector $\mathbf{k}$.

These fluctuations are driven by the random thermal motions of the electrons and the collective radiation they create is known as incoherent scatter \cite{kudeki:milla:1}. Even though incoherent scatter is driven through a random process it can give a number of different pieces of information about a plasma, especially in the ionosphere. Due to the electrical interaction between the ions and electrons a correlation structure develops and giving a shaped Doppler spectrum. In the end the incoherent scatter can give us a measurement of the power spectral density of the electron density, $\langle \left|n_e(\mathbf{k},\omega)\right|^2\rangle$.

There have been a number of derivations of this process since the development of ISR \cite{dougherty:farley1960,farleydougherty:ISR2,doughteryfarley:ISR3,hagfors1961}. For this thesis we will use the formulation from  \cite{kudeki:milla:1,kudeki:milla:2,Kudeki:2006kx}


\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mainspeceq:body}
\langle \left|n_e(\mathbf{k},\omega)\right|^2\rangle = \frac{|j\omega\epsilon_0 + \sigma_i|^2 \langle |n_{te}(\mathbf{k},\omega)|^2\rangle}{|j\omega\epsilon_0 +\sigma_e+\sigma_i|^2} + \frac{| \sigma_e|^2 \langle |n_{ti}(\mathbf{k},\omega)|^2\rangle}{|j\omega\epsilon_0 +\sigma_e+\sigma_i|^2}.
\end{equation}

\noindent The full derivation of this can be seen in Appendix \ref{appendix1} but an example of this spectrum, with a $|\mathbf{k}|=18.5$ rad/m and using parameters representative of the F-region ionosphere, can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:ispecch2}.

\end{figure}

The IS spectrum has a number of different sections separated in frequency but for this thesis we will focus on the "ion line" shown in Figure \ref{fig:ispecch2}. This naming is due to the IS spectrum is showing a damped version of ion acoustic waves,

\begin{equation} 
\label{eqn:ial}
\omega=k_0\sqrt{\frac{K_b(T_e+3T_i)}{m_i}}
\end{equation}

 \noindent where $k_0$ is the wavenumber, $K_b$ is Boltzman's constant, $m_i$ is the mass of the ion species, $T_e$ and $T_i$ are the temperatures of the electron and ions \cite{chen1984introduction}. Other plasma wave modes can be view but ion acoustic mode returns the most power and can give information on both electron and ions.

\section{Radar Signal Processing}
ISR systems like other pulsed radar systems radiate a signal, $y(t)$, that can be represented as a finite length pulse, $s(t)$ modulated by a complex sinusoid,

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:sigone}
y(t)=s(t)e^{j2\pi f_0 t}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $f_0$ is the transmit frequency in Hz. This transmit frequency can also be equivalently as $ f_0=c/\lambda_0$, where $\lambda_0$ is the wavelength of the transmitted wave and $c$ is the speed of light. This return signal, reflected off of a target, which assuming for now has no motion,

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:sigone}
y_r(t)=A_0s(t-\Delta t)e^{j2\pi f_0 (t-\Delta t)}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\Delta T$ round trip time and is $A_0$  is an amplitude of which is amplitude factor including propagation losses and target reflectivity \cite{richards2014fundamentals}. The radar system measures the range $r$, or the distance between the target and sensor, by simply measuring the and using the following conversion,

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:range_intro}
r=\frac{c\Delta T}{2}.
\end{equation}

\noindent Lastly, the signal is demodulated down to base band and it becomes the following

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:baseband}
x(t)=A_0s(t-\Delta t)e^{-j2\pi\Delta t}
\end{equation}

Another quantity that can be measured is the line of sight or Doppler velocity. The Doppler for this specific case acts multiplication of the radar signal $s(t)$ with a simple single complex exponential

\begin{equation}
\label{simpledop}
x_d(t) = x(t)e^{j2\pi f_d t},
\end{equation}
 
\noindent where $\omega_d$ is the Doppler frequency of the target. Assuming there are no relativistic effects this frequency can be represented as the following $f_d = 2v/\lambda_0 $, where $v$ is the velocity of the target. 



With ISR a distribution of electrons are actually being probed, so we have more than one target. A better model would be set of scatters each with their weighted return and Doppler frequency, which can be represented as the following

\begin{equation}
\label{multiDop}
\displaystyle x_d(t) = \sum_{n}^{N} x(t)V_ne^{j2\pi f_{n} t}.
\end{equation}


\noindent This then can be extended to a continuum of signals each at each Doppler frequency which becomes

\begin{equation}
\label{conDop}
x_d(t) = \int x(t) V(f)e^{j2\pi ft} df.
\end{equation}
\noindent Pulling the $x(t)$ term out of the integral we can see that we are taking the Fourier transform of this relative weighting between each of the scatters and then multiplying it with the signal.  Using simple Fourier properties we can see that this equivalent to a convolution in frequency space of the spectrum of the original radar signal and the Doppler spectrum with the collection of targets.  

The final form of the signal spectrum with Doppler added can be shown as the following

\begin{equation}
\label{finalDop}
x_d(t) = \int \left[\int X(\lambda)V(\lambda-f)d\lambda\right] e^{j\omega t}df.
\end{equation}

\noindent This shows that the measured Doppler on the radar signal can be formulated as the convolution of the Fourier transform of radar's signal along with the Doppler spectrum of the target.


This model can be extended to a much more general form from being just at a single range to being spread across range
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:scateqn}
x(t)= \int \int V(\mu,f)s(t-\mu)e^{j2\pi f t} d \mu df,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $V(\mu,\nu)$ is the scatter function and $\mu=2r/c$. One of the earlier uses of this form comes from the study of time varying communication channels \cite{Kailath:1962jx,Kailath:1963gh}. This scattering function drives the methodology on how the target can be properly measured. 

This creates two classes of targets, by what will be called is called their range bandwidth product. For the case of an an \textit{underspread} target,

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:trp}
B\frac{2r}{c}<1,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $B$ is the Doppler bandwidth \cite{Pfander:2015ea}. The case of the \textit{overspread} target occurs when this inequality does not hold.
\subsection{Doppler Measurement}

Pulsed radar systems are able to measure the Doppler spectrum of target, and to show ISR systems perform this two methods will be focused on. The first, pulse-Doppler, sends out a set of pulses, which scatter off of the target, and when received are then binned into a two dimensional array representing range and interpulse period (IPP). Then a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) across pulses is taken to determine the Doppler spectrum \cite{richards2014fundamentals}. In order to avoid any sort of aliasing, or Doppler folding, the pulse repetition frequency must be at least twice as large as largest Doppler frequency in the signal \cite{dtsp:openhiem}. A power spectrum is formed then by taking squared magnitude of the full range-Doppler map. The other method entails forming a measurement of the autocorrelation function (ACF) with in the IPP. A DFT across the lags is taken to then get the Doppler spectrum The formation of this spectrum is the same as forming Wigner-Ville distribution along range \cite{TFAcohen}.

Both of these measurements have trade offs. Using the pulse-Doppler method, a phase coherent signal that is relatively narrow in frequency can obtain a large amount of gain compared to the background noise. Still, the Doppler bandwidth that can be view unambiguously will be tied to the PRF. The issue of range ambiguity can arise if the . The maximum unambiguous range, $r_a$, can be represented as 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:maxuar}
r_a =  \frac{cT}{2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $T$ is the IPP time. The method using the Wigner-Ville distribution for the spectrum formation will not give nearly as much gain but it can form a much more broad band spectrum without having to decrease the unambiguous range \cite{richards2014fundamentals}.

When designing a moving target indicator (MTI) radar system the target's scattering function, approximated as delta, or some sort of compactly supported functions in range and Doppler \cite{richards2014fundamentals}. These types are generally underspread as their range extent and Doppler bandwidth will follow the inequality in Equation \ref{eqn:trp}. The ionosphere though is not compactly supported in range if one wants to do F-region studies, which can stretch from 150-700 km in altitude. Using the spectrum in Figure \ref{fig:ispecch2}, it can be seen that the signal is at least 20kHz in bandwidth which will will require the same PRF in order to sample it unambigiously. This would yield only 7.5 km of unambiguous range so it is necessary to use the Wigner-Ville distribution method on this overspread target. 



 %There are still cases of ISR systems that use a pulses Doppler technique, but these are generally relegated to D-region studies where the necessary unambiguous range is lower and the spectrums are narrower.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Processing %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{ISR Processing}
\label{section:isrproc}
The processing steps to create plasma parameter measurements from complex voltage data will covered in this section. First the method to estimate the ACF from an uncoded long pulse will be described. The second part will discuss how the plasma parameters are fit to the ACFs and how the expected errors are derived. 
 
\subsection{ACF Estimation}
\label{sec:acf}
After complex receiver voltage data has been created, it is processed to create estimates of the ACF at desired points of space \cite[see, e.g.,][]{farley1969,nygren1996}. This processing follows the flow chart presented in Figure \ref{fig:chain}.  Note that this signal pipeline will create a single altitude measurement for analysis. 

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6in]{datastackchain}
\caption{ISR signal processing chain, with signal processing operations as squares and data products as diamonds.}
\label{fig:chain}
\end{figure}


The lag product formation is an initial estimate of the autocorrelation function. The sampled complex receiver voltage can be represented as $x(n) \in\mathbb{C}^N$ where $N$ is the number of samples in an inter pulse period. For each range gate $m\in 0,1,...M-1$ a complex autocorrelation is estimated for each lag of $l \in 0,1...,L-1$.  To get better statistics this operation is performed for each pulse $j\in 0,1,...J-1$ and then summed over $J$ independent pulses. The entire operation to form the initial estimate of $\widehat{R}(m,l)$ may be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lagpro}
\widehat{R}(m,l) = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{j=0}^{J-1} x(m-\lfloor l/2\rfloor,j)x^*(m+\lceil l/2 \rceil,j).
\end{equation}

The case shown in Equation \ref{eq:lagpro} is a centered lag product.  Other types of lag product calculations are available but generally a centered product is used. In the centered lag product case range gate index $m$ and sample index $n$ can be related by $m=n-\lfloor L/2\rfloor$ and the maximum lag and sample relation is $M=N-\lceil L/2 \rceil$.  This lag product formation is the first step in taking a discrete Wigner Distribution \cite{TFAcohen}. This first step adds a bias to the ACF estimate which acts as a weighting on larger lags, represented as $\mathcal{W}(l)$ where weighting can be calculated from details of the range-lag ambiguity function along the range axis. The expected value for the estimator, assuming the use of a simple uncoded pulse waveform, becomes

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lagprobias}
\left\langle\widehat{R}(m,l) \right\rangle = \mathcal{W}(l)R(m,l) =\frac{L-l}{L}R(m,l).
\end{equation}
%This specific type of lag product formation is detailed in \cite{farley1969} and had been referred to as unbiased. This terminology does differ from what is used in statistic signal processing literature such as \cite{randomsigshanmugan} where the unbiased autocorrelation function estimate is carried out as so,
%
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:lagproub}
%\hat{R}(m,l) = \frac{1}{L-l}\displaystyle\sum\limits_{j=0}^{J-1} x(m-\lfloor l/2\rfloor,j)x^*(m+\lceil l/2 \rceil,j).
%\end{equation}
%
%\noindent With out the $\frac{1}{L-l}$ term the estimator will be windowed with a triangular function thus impacting the estimate of the ISR spectrum as this will act as a convolution in the frequency domain. This bias is taken into account in \cite{farley1969} but it is simply wrapped up into the ambiguity function. 

Applying a summation rule is generally the next step in creating an estimate of the autocorrelation function for single altitude analysis. This is done for a number of reasons, but primarily to improve estimate statistics.  Furthermore, if the right rule is chosen, then the range ambiguity can be made approximately constant across the lags, which can make inversions easier \cite{nygren1996}. Summation rules based on other criterial can be used but our simulations use the trapezoidal summation, which is a common choice and leads to the common resolution across all lags. It can be represented as follows.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sumrule}
\widehat{R}_s(m,l) = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=-((v-1)/2+\lceil l/2 \rceil)}^{((v-1)/2+\lfloor l/2\rfloor)} \widehat{R}(m+i,l),
\end{equation}

\noindent where $v$ is the 'volume' index or the number of gates integrated at zero lag (restricted to odd integers here) and $\widehat{R}_s(m,l)$ is the final ACF estimate after the summation rule \cite{nygren1996}. 
% pcom checked for variables, already defined
However, the final result of this summation rule will still lead to a biased ACF. For the uncoded waveform case, this summation rule leads to the following expected value for the estimator \cite{nygren1996},

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sumruleest}
\left\langle\widehat{R}_s(m,l) \right\rangle  =\frac{v+l}{v\mathcal{W}(0)}\mathcal{W}(l)R(m,l) =\left(-\frac{1}{vL}l^2+\frac{L-v}{Lv}l+1\right)   R(m,l).
\end{equation}
%An example summation rule for a central product is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sumrule}. In the figure the image on the left is a basic representation of an ambiguity function of a long pulse.  Its mirrored on the right with red bars which would show the integration area under it so the ambiguity function for each lag will be of equal size in range. There are a number of different summing rule each with their own trade offs \cite{nygren1996}.

%In the processing this is basically a summing of lags from different ranges. The amount of summing is similar to what is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sumrule}.   



%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:lagpronoise}
%\hat{R}_w(m,l) = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{j=0}^{J-1} w(m_w-\lfloor l/2\rfloor,j)w^*(m_w+\lceil l/2 \rceil,j),
%\end{equation}

Finally, noise effects are included by subtracting an estimate of the noise correlation from $\widehat{R}_s(m,l)$.  The noise correlation function is represented as $\widehat{R}_w(m,l)$, the ACF estimate of the background noise process of the radar $w(n_w)$ using the steps in Equations \ref{eq:lagpro} and \ref{eq:sumrule}. In a real radar system the noise process is typically sampled either during a calibration period for the radar when nothing is being emitted, or at ranges sufficiently distant that scattered ionospheric signal is assumed to be negligible. For our simulated estimate, we simply use a noise process with the same correlation structure and power as the noise that was added. The final estimate of the autocorrelation function after the noise subtraction and summation rule is represented by $\widehat{R}_f(m,l)$.

After the final estimation of the spectrum is complete, nonlinear least squares fitting takes place to determine plasma parameters.

\subsection{Parameter Fitting}
The class of nonlinear least squares problems relevant to ISR parameter estimation can be represented as the minimization of a cost function of the form \cite{kayvol1},

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{\hat{p}}= \underset{\mathbf{p}}{\text{argmin}} (\mathbf{y}-\bm{\theta}(\mathbf{p}))^*\bm{\Sigma}^{-1}(\mathbf{y}-\bm{\theta}(\mathbf{p})).
\label{nlls}
\end{equation}

In Equation \ref{nlls}, the data represented as $\mathbf{y}$ would be the final estimate of the ACF $\widehat{R}_f(m,l)$ at a specific range, or its spectrum $\widehat{S}_f(m,\omega)$. The parameter vector $\mathbf{P}$ would be the plasma parameters $N_e$, $T_e$, $T_i$ and $V_i$. The fit function, $\bm{\theta}$, is the IS spectrum calculated from a models e.g., \cite{kudeki:milla:1} and smeared by the ambiguity function. In the case of the long pulse the ambiguity can be simply applied by multiplying it with the autocorrelation function $R(l)$ if the summation rule is properly applied. As in previous publications, e.g.,\cite{nikoukar2008}, the Levenberg-Marquart algorithm is used to fit the plasma parameters to the ACFs or spectra \cite{levenberg1944,marquardt:1963}.
%Using the covariance matrix from the fitted parameters, an overall error estimate can be achieved. This matrix is calculated using a numerical approximation to the Jacobian matrix that the function uses to determine the solution. Due to the way the numerical routines solve the problem, this matrix must be multiplied by the error between the estimated parameters and the data,

The last step is to calculate the errors in the parameter estimates. In order to do this a numerical approximation of the jacobian matrix between the data and the ACF, $\mathbf{J}$, at $\mathbf{p}=\mathbf{\hat{p}}$. The formula to estimate the parameter error matrix, $\mathbf{C}_{\mathbf{\hat{p}}}$ according to \cite{Hysell:2000cq}, is


\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:jacinv}
\mathbf{C}_{\mathbf{\hat{p}}}=(\mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{C}^{-1}\mathbf{J})^{-1},
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eqn:jacinv}
%\bm{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{\hat{p}}}=\frac{(\mathbf{J}^T\mathbf{J})^{-1} (\mathbf{y}-\bm{\theta}(\mathbf{\hat{p}}))^*\bm{\Sigma}^{-1}(\mathbf{y}-\bm{\theta}(\mathbf{\hat{p}}))}{L-N_{\mathbf{p}}},
%\end{equation}

\noindent where $ \mathbf{C}$ is the covariance matrix from the ACFs or spectra depending on what is being fit. The covariance matrix for the ACF is detailed in Equation \ref{eqn:covcalc}, 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:covcalc}
C_{\tau_1,\tau_2} = \frac{1}{2J} \left( \ R(0)  R^*(\tau_1-\tau_2) +  R(\tau_1) R^*(\tau_2) \right),
\end{equation}

\noindent while the covariance matrix of the spectra is simply the ACF matrix but with discrete Fourier Transforms applied to the rows and columns. The variances of the parameters are then taken as the diagonals of the matrix.


%The correlation matrix $\bm{\Sigma}$ is often realized as a diagonal matrix for many ISR systems the variance of the lags or each point of the spectrum being the values. The variance of the ACF estimator can be estimated using the following,
%
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eqn:acfvar}
%\sigma_{\hat{R}(l)}^2=\frac{1}{JL}\displaystyle \sum_{m=-(L-l-1)}^{L-l-1}\left(\frac{L-|m|+1}{L}\right)\left(|\hat{R}(m)|^2 +|\hat{R}(m+l)\hat{R}(m-l)|\right) + \hat{N}^2
%\end{equation}
%
%\noindent where $N$ is the estimated noise power. To estimate the spectrum variance the matrix $\bm{\Sigma}$ is transformed in to the Fourier domain using FFTs (FFT on the columns and IFFT on the rows) so as to model the $\mathbf{F}\bm{\Sigma} \mathbf{F}^*$ matrix operation. 



%%
The diagonal values usually used, noted as $\sigma_i^2$, usually the same unless there is a larger measurement error for one of the lags or spectrums.  The following formula from  \cite{nicollsisrschool2013} can be used:

\begin{equation}
\label{sigpow}
\sigma_i = \frac{S}{\sqrt{J}}\left(1+\frac{1}{SNR}\right).
\end{equation}

\noindent where $S$ is the signal power and $SNR$ is the signal to noise ratio. The noise level can be estimated from the calibration period. 

In the past, ISR researchers have used the Levenberg-Marquart algorithm to fit data \cite{nikoukar2008}. This specific iterative algorithm moves the parameter vector $\mathbf{p}$ by a perturbation $\mathbf{h}$ at each iteration\cite{gavin:2013}. Specifically Levenberg-Marquart was designed to be a sort of meld between two different methods Gradient Decent, and Gauss-Newton. The perturbation vector $\mathbf{h}_{lm}$ can be calculated using the following:

\begin{equation}
\left[ \mathbf{J}^T\bm{\Sigma}^{-1}\mathbf{J}\right]\mathbf{h}_{lm} =\mathbf{J}^T\bm{\Sigma}^{-1}(\mathbf{y}-\bm{\theta}(\mathbf{p}))
\label{hlm}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathbf{J}$ is the Jacobian matrix $\partial \bm{\theta}/\partial \mathbf{p}$ \cite{levenberg1944,marquardt:1963}. 

%Using the covariance matrix from the fitted parameters, an overall error estimate can be achieved. This matrix is calculated using a numerical approximation to the Jacobian matrix that the function uses to determine the solution. The Hessian, $\mathbf{H}$ is then calculated by using the Jacobian and then inverted to get the covariance matrix. Due to the way the numerical routines solve the problem, this matrix must be multiplied by the error between the estimated parameters and the data,
%
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eqn:jacinv}
%\bm{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{\hat{p}}}=\frac{(\mathbf{J}^T\mathbf{J})^{-1} (\mathbf{y}-\bm{\theta}(\mathbf{\hat{p}}))^*\bm{\Sigma}^{-1}(\mathbf{y}-\bm{\theta}(\mathbf{\hat{p}}))}{L-N_{\mathbf{p}}},
%\end{equation}

%\noindent where $N_{\mathbf{p}}$ is the number of parameters being fit. The variances of the parameters are then taken as the diagonals of the matrix.}

 %If the Hessian matrix is undefined so it can not be inverted and a proper estimate of the errors is not possible.
