There's an old saying, "it takes a village to raise a child." A similar statement can be made for a PhD student and their thesis. The first part is in this village that must be mentioned is my committee starting with my advisor, Professor Josh Semeter, who has helped me chase my ideas to fruition and create a piece of my own scholarship. Dr. Phil Erickson at MIT Haystack Observatory has been incredibly helpful and patient in developing this work and without his guidance this would not be possible. Both Professor Hamid Nawab and Professor David Castañón have been very helpful through the great classes they have taught and lending advice on how best to tackle problems.

Before more specific people are detailed I think it needs to be said that Boston University has some incredible institutions within it. The two that have had the most impact on have been ECE department and the Center for Space Physics. These two institutions have exposed me to a number of different of fascinating ideas and people that I would be hard pressed to find anywhere else.

I have had also a large amount of help from other researchers in the geospace field. This includes Dr. Hanna Dahlgren who was hugely helpful when I was first getting started in the lab. Prof. Matt Zettergren has been extremely helpful in providing simulation data and invaluable advice on other areas.

The are a number of other staff members I would like to thank from MIT Haystack Observatory for all there help. This includes Anthea Coster, Frank Lind, Victor Pankratius, Bill Rideout and Juha Vierinen. 

Staff members from SRI international, have been very helpful as well. This include Mike Nicolls, Steven Chen, Roger Varney and Mary McCready.
 
Accompanying me on my wild ride through academia are my labmates, Nithin, Brent, Michael, Chhavi, Hassan, Sebastian, Greg and Thomas. They have all been excellent collaborators and friends. I also have to add into this mix Matt and Dustin, who although are in a different department, need to be mentioned as if they were part of this group.
