	Abstract = {The Optical Mesosphere Thermosphere Imagers (OMTI) have been developed to investigate the dynamics of the upper atmosphere through nocturnal airglow emissions. The OMTI consist of an imaging Fabry-Perot interferometer, three all-sky cooled-CCD cameras, three tilting photometers, and a Spectral Airglow Temperature Imager (SATI) with two container houses to install them in. These instruments measure wind, temperature and 2-dimensional airglow patterns in the upper atmosphere at multi-wavelengths of OI (557.7 nm and 630.0 nm), OH (6--2) bands, O2 (0, 1) bands, and Na (589.3 nm), simultaneously. Examples of the data are shown for the cameras, the photometers, and the SATI based on the airglow observation at a mid-latitude station in Japan. Good correlation of the photometer and SATI observations is obtained. A comparison is shown for small- and large-scale wave structures in airglow images at four wavelengths around the mesopause region using four cooled-CCD cameras. We found an event during which large-scale bands, small-scale row-like structures, and large-scale front passage occur simultaneously.},

@article{Shiokawa2009,
	Abstract = {We review measurements of nighttime atmospheric/ionospheric waves in the upper atmosphere in Japan, Indonesia, and Australia, using all-sky airglow imagers of optical mesosphere thermosphere imagers (OMTIs). The imagers observe two-dimensional patterns of airglow emissions from oxygen (wavelength: 557.7 nm) and hydroxyl (OH) (near-infrared band) in the mesopause region (80--100 km) and from oxygen (630.0 nm) in the thermosphere/ionosphere (200--300 km). Several statistical studies were done to investigate propagation characteristics of small-scale (less than 100 km) gravity waves in the mesopause region and medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs, ∼100--1,000 km) in the thermosphere/ionosphere. Clear seasonal variations of occurrence and propagation directions were reported for these waves. The propagation directions in the mesopause region are controlled by wind filtering, ducting processes and relative location to the wave sources in the troposphere. Poleward-propagating waves tend to be observed in the summer in the mesopause region at several stations, suggesting that mesospheric gravity waves are generated by intense convective activity in the equatorial troposphere. On the other hand, systematic equatorward and westward motions were observed for all seasons for nighttime MSTIDs in the midlatitude ionosphere with geomagnetic conjugacy between the northern and southern hemispheres. Ionospheric instabilities may play important role for the generation and propagation of these MSTIDs. We also give an example of simultaneous observation of quasi-periodic southward-moving waves in the mesopause region and in the thermosphere at the geographic equator. From these results, we discuss mean wind acceleration by mesospheric gravity waves and penetration of gravity waves from the mesosphere to the thermosphere.},

It develops from first principles the concepts needed to plan, execute, and interpret plasma diagnostics. The book is therefore accessible to graduate students and professionals with little specific plasma physics background, but is also a valuable reference for seasoned plasma physicists. Most of the examples are taken from laboratory plasma research, but the focus on principles makes the treatment useful to all experimental and theoretical plasma physicists, including those interested in space and astrophysical applications. This second edition is thoroughly revised and updated, with new sections and chapters covering recent developments in the field. Specific areas of added coverage include neutral-beam-based diagnostics, flow measurement with mach probes, equilibrium of strongly shaped plasmas and fusion product diagnostics.},

	Abstract = {The terrestrial plasma located in altitude above the electron density peak is known as the topside ionosphere, and is coupled to the F region through flows parallel to the magnetic field. We present in this dissertation observations of both the mid-latitude and equatorial topside ionosphere using the technique of incoherent scatter. After reviewing basic theories of topside dynamics, we introduce the incoherent scatter technique and describe its application to topside observations. In particular, we develop a novel application of constrained nonlinear least squares analysis techniques to solve a parameter ambiguity problem characteristic of incoherent scatter from the mixture of oxygen, hydrogen, and helium ions present at topside altitudes. The constraint method we employ encourages smooth behavior of electron and ion temperature variation, and yields physically reasonable and self-consistent measurements of density, temperature, and composition. Using the results of the new technique, we then investigate three features of topside behavior seen in incoherent scatter measurements made at both the mid-latitude Arecibo Observatory and the equatorial Jicamarca Radio Observatory. The observations were taken at Arecibo during two periods characteristic of wintertime solar maximum and equinox solar minimum, with simultaneous Jicamarca topside measurements available during the latter period. Large nighttime altitude variations in Arecibo horizontal density gradients are observed during wintertime but not at equinox, and are driven by conjugate heating from southern hemisphere photoelectron flux during early morning hours. We also present helium ion density measurements which peak during the daytime at the equator, but in contrast form a nighttime layer at mid-latitudes whose altitude is well predicted by simple ambipolar diffusion theory. Finally, we exploit the simultaneous Arecibo and Jicamarca topside data to derive the first complete field-aligned density profiles using ground-based radar observations, and we show that perpendicular density advection is a more significant supplier of oxygen ions to the nighttime F region than downwards flows from the protonosphere. We close by summarizing the dissertation, and we offer suggestions for future studies.},

	Abstract = {Due to ill-conditioning of the linearised forward problem and the presence of noise in most data, inverse problems generally require some kind of 'regularisation' in order to generate physically plausible solutions. The most popular method of regularised inversion is damped least squares. Damping sometimes forces the solution to be smoother than it otherwise would be by raising all of the eigenvalues in an ad hoc fashion. An alternative is described, based upon the method of least-absolute deviation, which has a property known in the statistical literature as robustness. An account of robust inversion methods-their history and computational developments-is given. The key computational technique turns out to be preconditioned conjugate gradient, an algorithm which had as its genesis 'the method of orthogonal vectors' by Fox, Huskey and Wilkinson (1948). Applications are illustrated from seismic tomography and inverse scattering, two of the most computationally intensive tasks in inverse theory.},

The inversion method uses microlocal analysis in a statistical setting to design a backprojection filter that reduces the impact of noise and clutter while preserving the fidelity of the target image. We assume an isotropic single scattering model for the electromagnetic radiation that illuminates the scene of interest. We assume a priori statistical information on the target, clutter and noise. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm and its ability to better resolve targets through numerical simulations.},

	Abstract = {This paper defines and studies a new class of non-stationary random processes constructed from discrete non-decimated wavelets which generalizes the Cram{\'e}r (Fourier) representation of stationary time series. We define an evolutionary wavelet spectrum (EWS) which quantifies how process power varies locally over time and scale. We show how the EWS may be rigorously estimated by a smoothed wavelet periodogram and how both these quantities may be inverted to provide an estimable time-localized autocovariance. We illustrate our theory with a pedagogical example based on discrete non-decimated Haar wavelets and also a real medical time series example.},

	Abstract = {We develop a technique for using monostatic, electronically steerable
	incoherent scatter radar (ISR) to generate 2-D estimates of F region
	flow fields. Tikhonov regularization is used to achieve robustness
	in the presence of spatial variation. The regularization functional
	imposes partial incompressibility on the medium and is therefore
	physically justified. Although the estimator has difficulty resolving
	sharp discontinuities, it performs well in regions of uniform flow.
	In order to characterize the effect of the regularization parameter,
	we test the performance of the operator in three simulated scenarios.
	We then analyze data from an experiment on the Poker Flat ISR. The
	experimental results are validated against coregistered all-sky optical
	data and are found to be mostly consistent with these independent
	measurements. Namely, the radar-derived estimates show a reduction
	of ion flow wherever the optical data indicates an auroral enhancement.
	The estimated flow is directed parallel to an arc boundary, consistent
	with an electric field directed toward the arc.},

	scattered radiation is calculated. Particular attention is paid to
	the part of the spectrum which corresponds to small Doppler shifts,
	this being the region of greatest significance in connexion with
	the phenomenon of incoherent scattering from the ionosphere. The
	calculations are based on a generalized version of Nyquist's noise
	theorem, and they lead to the following conclusions: (1) The mean
	scattering cross-section for the ionosphere is equal to that which
	would exist if each of the electrons scattered independently with
	a cross-section of one-half the classical Thomson cross-section.
	(2) The mean Doppler broadening of the scattered signal corresponds
	roughly to the speed of the ions rather than to that of the electrons.
	(3) The spectral shape of this signal is not Gaussian. There is a
	mild maximum in the spectrum away from the central frequency, as
	can be seen in figure 1. (4) Plasma resonance effects contribute
	only negligibly to the scattering for frequencies currently of interest.},

	Abstract = {Single-pulse and double-pulse methods for measuring the cross-correlation
	(two polarizations transmitted and received) or auto-correlation
	(one polarization only) function of the scattered signal are described.
	The statistical errors associated with various forms of multi-bit
	(no quantization errors in the sampling process), one-bit, and hybrid
	estimators of the correlation function are calculated and compared,
	both for large and small signal-to-noise ratios. Roughly speaking,

	samples as the multi-bit estimators to achieve the same statistical
	accuracy, but this disadvantage is often more than compensated for
	by an increase in the effective sampling rate. When the correlation
	is 0.5 or more, there may be a substantial difference between estimators
	of the same class (multi-bit, for example). Systematic distortions
	of the correlation function and limitations on resolution associated

@article{farleydougherty:ISR2,
	Abstract = {A general expression for the frequency spectrum of radio waves scattered
	by the random thermal fluctuations of electron density in a plasma
	in a magnetic field is derived. The derivation is based on the generalized
	Nyquist noise theorem used in part I. The exact result is then simplified
	by means of an approximation which amounts to assuming the velocity
	of light to be infinite. It is shown that this approximation is quite
	adequate for ionospheric applications of the theory. Next it is proved,
	without appealing to any approximation, that the magnetic field can
	never alter the total scattered signal power: it can only redistribute
	this power over the spectrum. Finally, the detailed shape of the
	frequency spectrum of the scattered signal is examined. Analytic
	expressions are given for certain limiting cases, but for the cases
	of most interest, numerical methods must be used. The results of
	some numerical calculations are shown in figures 1 and 2. From these
	results, it can be seen that the magnetic field has a significant
	effect on the shape of the spectrum only if the incident radio beam
	is very nearly orthogonal to the magnetic lines of force. For example,
	for an operating frequency of 40 Mc/s, no significant magnetic effect
	is observed even when the beam is within 5? of orthogonality. As
	this angle is decreased further, however, the spectrum rapidly begins
	to develop spikes at Doppler shifts which are approximate multiples
	of the ion gyro-frequency. These spikes are quite pronounced when
	the beam is 2? from orthogonality. At higher operating frequencies,
	the beam must be proportionally closer to orthogonality to achieve
	the same effect.},

@article{semeter:plasmatransport2012,
	Abstract = {A detailed study of the effects of auroral current systems on thermal
	ionospheric plasma transport and loss is conducted using a new ionospheric
	model. The mathematical formulation of the model is a variation on
	the 5-moment approximation which describes the temporal evolution
	of density, drift, and temperature for five different ion species
	in two spatial dimensions. The fluid system is closed through a 2-D
	electrostatic treatment of the auroral currents. This model is used
	to examine the interplay between ion heating, perpendicular transport,
	molecular ion generation, and type-1 ion upflows in a self-consistent
	way for the first time. Simulations confirm that the depletion of
	E-region plasma due to current closure occurs on extremely fast time
	scales (5\&{\#}8211;30 s), and that it is dependent on current system
	scale size. Near the F-region peak, the loss is mostly due to enhanced
	recombination from the conversion of the plasma to molecular ions.
	The F-region loss process is fairly slow (120\&{\#}8211;300 s) by
	comparison to lower altitude processes and is highly electric field
	dependent. On similar time scales, transient ion upflows from frictional
	heating move plasma from the near topside ionosphere (\&{\#}8764;500
	km) to higher regions, leaving depletions and enhancing plasma densities
	at very high altitudes. Results indicate the existence of large molecular
	ion upflows near the F-region peak and may shed some light on ionospheric
	source regions for outflowing molecular ions. Neutral atmospheric
	winds and densities are also shown to play an important role in modulating
	molecular ion densities, frictional heating, and currents.},
