This chapter will describe methods developed to invert the ISR space-time ambiguity function and improve on current reconstruction schemes. The first section will describe these inversion methods which are different types of constrained least squares. The next section will show examples using runs from STISRS to determine the utility of these inversion on reconstructing the true plasma parameters.
